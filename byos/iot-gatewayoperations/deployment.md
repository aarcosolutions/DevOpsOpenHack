# IOT Gateway Operations Openhack #

## Setting up Permissions 

Before continuing ensure you understand the permissions needed to run the OpenHack on your Azure subscription.

**Initial Setup** 

To perform the setup and deployment to prepare for the OpenHack you must be be assigned to the Owner role on the Azure subscription(s).

To validate this, navigate to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a>. Click on **All Services** -> **Subscriptions** -> **Access Control (IAM)**.

Enter the email address in the **Check access** text box to view the current permissions of the user performing the setup.

**Performing the OpenHack** 

Each attendee in the OpenHack will be assigned the **Owner** role on a resource group unique to their team. This is covered later in this document in the deployment section.  

## Common Azure Resources 

The following is a list of common Azure resources that are deployed and utilized during the OpenHack.  

Ensure that these services are not blocked by Azure Policy.  As this is an OpenHack, the services that attendees can utilize are not limited to this list so subscriptions with a tightly controlled service catalog may run into issues if the service an attendee wishes to use is disabled via policy.

## Attendee Computers

Attendees will be required to install software on the workstations that they are performing the OpenHack on. Ensure they have adequate permissions to perform software installation. 

In lieu of developer machines, a low-cost azure virtual machine could be used for development.

# Deployment Instructions #  

### For deployment, you will run a powershell script that executes an ARM template to setup the appropriate Resource Group for each team.  You will then manually add team members as owwers to the resource group. ###

### Powershell ###
1. Open a **PowerShell ISE** window, run the following command, if prompted, click **Yes to All**:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```

2. Make sure you have the latest PowerShell Azure module installed by executing the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    ```  

3. If you installed an update, **close** the PowerShell ISE window, then **re-open** it. This ensures that the latest version of the Az module is used.

4. Execute the following to sign in to the Azure account:

    ```PowerShell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

5. Open the `iot-gatewayoperations\deploy\deployAll.ps1` PowerShell script in the PowerShell ISE window.  There is **nothing** to update, but if you wanted you ***could*** set the location and not require the read-in from the prompt.:

    ```PowerShell
    $region = Read-Host "What Region Resources be deployed to (i.e. centralus, southcentralus, japaneast, etc)?";
    #could be
    $region = "centralus"
    ```

6.  Press **F5** to run the script, this will do the following:
> *Note: if you receive an error that `azuredeploy.json` cannot be found, make sure the current directory of the Console window of **ISE** is the `iot-gatewayoperations\deploy` folder.*  

   * Create resource group entitled **IoTGatewayOpsOpenHackRGXX-[location]** where XX is the two-digit team number and location is the location you entered or have in the script.  For example, team 2 in eastus would have RG set to `IoTGatewayOpsOpenHackRG02-eastus`.  

### Manual step ### 

7. After deployment, manually add appropriate users with owner access on the appropriate resource group for their team, so that they will have ability to create and deploy resources in that resource group.

# Deployment Artifacts / Validation #

### After deployment has completed, you should see the following resources in each team's Resource Group: ###

* Team XX resource group  (i.e. `IoTGatewayOpsOpenHackRG02-eastus`)
