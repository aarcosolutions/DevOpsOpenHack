# Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework OpenHack

This deployment guide will assist you in deploying the required resources and artifacts for the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected OpenHack.

> Total deployment time may take **15-20 minutes** for provisioning Azure resources.

## Prerequisites

Because of the complexity of the deployment, it is _highly_ recommended to use Docker for deploying resources. While you can attempt to interpret the deployment shell script, it is not advised. Being as such, besides an Azure subscription and Azure DevOps account, **Docker is the _only_ prerequisite** and approximately 20GB of temporary space to build the container.

It is also worth noting that, unless limits have been increased, typical Azure tenants may not have the necessary compute allocation to deploy the initial resources.

## Artifacts

Beyond the deployment of the environments as described below, the following artifacts from the OpenHack _source_ should be deployed to their respective portal environment so that they are accessible to coaches and attendees during the event.

### Coach's Portal

The following artifacts should be deployed to the coach's portal:

* Coach's Guides: `/resources/guides/challenges/**/*`
* PowerPoint Decks
    * Tech Scenario: `/resources/ppt/OpenHack_Tech Scenario_Attendee_Coach_Deck_WAF.pptx`
    * Virtual Coach Standup: `/resources/ppt/OpenHack_Virtual_Coach Standup_WAF.pptx`
    * Virtual Know Before You Go (KBYG) Coach Prep: `/resources/ppt/OpenHack_Virtual_KBYG.Coach Prep Deck_WAF.pptx`
    * Virtual Opening Deck: `/resources/ppt/OpenHack_Virtual_Opening Deck_WAF.pptx`
* Sample Issues: `/resources/Sample_Issues.docx`
* Success Matrix: `/resources/successMatrix.xlsx`

### Attendee's Portal

The following artifacts will be deployed to the public artifacts repo:

* Woodgrove Bank WAF Assessment: `/tools/Woodgrove_Bank_Assessment_2021-08-31.docx`
* Architecture Assessment Template: `/tools/Architecture_Assessment.docx`
* k6 Demo and Documentation: `/tools/k6/**/*`

## Deployment

Please fully read this section _prior to_ attempting a deployment. As stated above, Docker is recommended for deploying the OpenHack due to the deployment complexity. Therefore, all instructions will be based on this approach. Also, the Docker image is only required for _deployment_. Once the OpenHack has been deployed to your Azure and DevOps tenants, you can delete the local Docker image to reclaim space.

All available parameters for deployments are listed below. Additionally, some examples are provided for different scenarios.

>NOTE: During the deployment, generating the ARM template from the Bicep definition files will generate some warnings. This is expected and due to the Azure REST API not being updated.

In a deployment, only a single service principal is created with RBAC privileges in the Azure tenant. You will be required to supply a pre-configured Azure DevOps tenant and a PAT for the deployment process.

### Stages of deployment

The deployment has four basic stages:

1) Create the required Azure identity
2) Deploy Azure portal artifacts
3) Deploy Azure DevOps artifacts

### Available parameters

Azure AD username and password are always required if you are **NOT** using a device login.

| Flag | Required | Description |
| :--: | :------: | ----------- |
| `-u` | | **REQUIRED IF NOT USING "Device Login."**<br />Your Azure AD account email address. |
| `-p` | | **REQUIRED IF NOT USING "Device Login."**<br />Your Azure AD account password.<br /><br />NOTE: It may be helpful to enclose your password in single quotes if your password contains special characters. |
| `-t` | **Yes** | Your Azure tenant unique ID (for example, a GUID). |
| `-s` | **Yes** | Your Azure subscription ID (for example, a GUID). |
| `-a` | **Yes** | The name of your pre-created Azure DevOps tenant. |
| `-m` | **Yes** | Your _manually created_ Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT). |
| `-d` | | If your tenant requires multi-factor authentication (MFA), this flag is **required**. This will allow you to authenticate in a browser in order to run Azure CLI commands as MFA restricts username/password authentication via `az login`. |
| `-v` | | Enables verbose logging. |

### Manually generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Azure DevOps

You will need to create a PAT with the two permissions listed below. Note that it is not important what name you assign to the PAT or its expiration date. The only requirements are that the PAT is assigned to your Azure DevOps organization and setting the two permissions:

1) **Code** - _Full_
2) **Project and Team** - _Read, write, & manage_

> (NOTE: You will need to click on _"Show all scopes"_ at the bottom of the blade in order to find the **Project and Team** permission scope.)

If you need help creating a PAT, review the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).

### Examples

#### Build the Docker image

Prior to running any of the below examples, you will need to first build an image. In the project's root folder execute the following:

```bash
docker build . -t wafopenhack
```

This will create a Docker container image called _wafopenhack_. You can actually choose whatever you'd like for the name of the container. However, the examples below assumes that you've chosen this name for your image.

> NOTE: Creating an image for the first time may take a few minutes and is largely dependent on how fast resources (other image layers) can be downloaded and the deployment application compiling.

#### Using device login

This approach is used for Azure AD tenants _requiring_ MFA authentication.

```bash
docker run -it wafopenhack -s <subscriptionId> -t <tenantId> -a <devOpsTenant> -m <PAT> -d
```

Upon running this, you will be directed to a website where you will need to enter a code and authenticate. Upon successful authentication, the script will proceed.

#### Using a username and password

This approach is used for Azure AD tenants _not_ requiring MFA authentication.

```bash
docker run -it wafopenhack -u <email> -p <password> -s <subscriptionId> -t <tenantId> -a <devOpsTenant> -m <PAT>
```
